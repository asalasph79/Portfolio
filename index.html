            <p>I am an up and coming Web Designer & Developer based in Indianapolis, Indiana. I am about to graduate from Purdue's School of                Technology and Engineering at the end of the fall semester with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Technology with a                concentration in Web Development. I am Highly experienced in designing & developing custom websites and web applications in a range                of different coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Exceptionally creative and dependable Information Technology                professional with a stellar customer service record and superb work ethic. Broadly and deeply knowledgeable in a wide variety of                computer languages as well as the principles and techniques of website construction and maintenance. Highly adept at conveying                complex technical information to a variety of professional and lay audiences in a clear and understandable manner</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1979. As a young boy I became interested in technology and in how the inner                working of the technology, when family members brought home pieces of damaged equipment for me to play with. Instead of playing with               the equipment I took it upon myself to explore inside the machines and tried to get them in working order. As I kept growing into a                teenager my thirst for knowledge also grew. When I saw a computer in the garbage, I remember that I picked them up and explored the                insides of these magnificent devices and became familiar with some of its components. </p>
